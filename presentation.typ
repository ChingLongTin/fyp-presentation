Well-known optimization technique (ref here)

In here, green to annotates code to be executed in the next stage, and grey executed in the current stage.

  Rule for ```js .!```: evaluate until we turn the whole code fragment into the next stage, then move it to the current stage.

== Class specialization

#columns(2)[
#local(lang-format: (_, _, _) => [],
```js
class B(val x) with
  fun f() = ...
// ...
if x is
  1 then new D1(1)
  2 then new D2(2)
  3 then new D3(3)

x.f()
```
)

#colbreak()

#codly(skips: ((1, 7), ))
```js
if x is
  D1 then x.D1_f1()
  D2 then x.D2_f1()
  D3 then x.D3_f1()
```
]

Even if `x` has a known class shape, we cannot remove matching arms.

#v(3em)

In the previous slide, specialization is done through typing, so we know that
`x : B`, but we do not know which specific derived class of `B` is used.



= Overview

== MLscript Compiler

The #emoji.sparkles Lowering #emoji.sparkles stage (boo i don't care that #emoji.sparkles has GenAI connotations)

== Lowering Pass

Term => Scala Block

We do instrumentation from Scala Block => Scala Block.


= Implementation

#slide[
```js
staged module A with
  fun pow(x, n) = if n is
    0 then 1
    else x * pow(x, n-1)
  fun sq(x) = pow(x, 2)
```

// check in with our result and see if it works
#codly(skips:((1,4),))
```js
  fun sq(x) = x * x * 1
```

This example touches on shape tracking, match arm removal, and nested specialization.
]

== Staging

#slide[
```Scala
case class Match(scrut, arms, dflt, rest) extends Block
case class Return(scrut, arms, dflt, rest) extends Block
case class Assign(lhs, rhs, rest) extends Block
```

```js
class Block with
  constructor
    Return(res, implct)
    Match(scrut, arms, dflt, rest)
    Assign(lhs, rhs, rest)
```

For any Scala Block data, we can recreate the same structure in Staged Block.
]

#slide[
  ```js fun pow(x, n) = if n is 0 then 1 else x * pow(x, n-1) ```

  #text(0.8em)[

  #alternatives[
  ```Scala
  val pow = Symbol("pow"); val x = Symbol("x"); val n = Symbol("n")
  val t1 = Symbol("tmp"); val t2 = Symbol("tmp")
  val sub = Symbol("-"); val mul = Symbol("*")
  FunDefn(pow, [x, n], Scoped(HashSet(t1, t2), Match(Ref(n),
    [[ Lit(0), Return(Lit(1)) ]],
    Assign(t1, Call(sub, [n, Lit(1)]), 
      Assign(t2, Call(pow, [x, t1]), 
        Return(Call(mul, [x, t2]))
      )
    ), End())
  ))
  ```][
    ```js
    let pow = Symbol("pow"); let x = Symbol("x"); let n = Symbol("n")
    let t1 = Symbol("tmp"); let t2 = Symbol("tmp")
    let sub = Symbol("-"); let mul = Symbol("*")
    FunDefn(pow, [x, n], Scoped([t1, t2], Match(Ref(n),
      [[ Lit(0), Return(Lit(1)) ]],
      Assign(t1, Call(sub, [n, Lit(1)]), 
        Assign(t2, Call(pow, [x, t1]), 
          Return(Call(mul, [x, t2]))
        )
      ), End())
    ))
    ```
  ]
  
  ]

  As long as we have the corresponding constructor, we can copy over the structure to the Staged Block.
]

#slide[
  We perform structural induction to stage each type of Scala Block.

  ```js Assign(lhs, rhs, rest)```
  
  #codly(highlights: (
    (line: 1, start: 9, fill: green),
    (line: 2, start: 9, fill: green),
    (line: 3, start: 9, fill: green),
  ))
  ```js
  let l = lhs
  let r = rhs
  let b = rest
  Assign(l, r, b)
  ```
]

#slide[
  === Staging Symbols

  - We need more information about the Symbol in the original stage (particularly, tracking the previous stage values)

    Add extra field to point to current stage's value

    Add redirection within current stage to allow access for next module
      
  - We want Symbols for the same object in the previous stage to be unique in the current stage across functions
    
    Cache and use first instance of a symbol.

#place(horizon + center, $mapsto$)

== Shape propagation
for the per-block thing, saving the function calls until specialization?

`<shape definitions>`, tracking shapes

refinement by pattern matching / selection

function calls: find the correct functions, for both staged and non-staged functions



== Specialization
how each individual function is called and specialized, combined with the caching

=== Entry functions

Those act as points that the user can call the staged module with. Other specialized functions are there too but they're mine. You can't touch them.



== Printing Staged Block

After all the specialized functions are completed, we need to write the functions to a new file.


= Testing

relevant?


= Benchmarking

== Model-View-Projection transformation

basically we're pretty good at partially evaluating matrices ^w^.
